It's what gives turmeric its bright yellow colour and is responsible for many of its potential health benefits. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may help to reduce inflammation and fight oxidative stress. It can be hard for the body to absorb curcumin, so we added black pepper extract to our supplement to help the body better digest and extract all its benefits."

Turmeric may help to reduce inflammation, which can contribute to obesity and metabolic disorders. Nutriburst's Turmeric 3000mg contains a potent dose of curcuminoids, which may support healthy weight management as part of a balanced diet and exercise routine. It's important to speak with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have any pre-existing health conditions."
